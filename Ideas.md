## What is different to other systems?
I build phobox to solve a problem which I have with all existing tools. I want to keep my photos on my network storage
to access them in my local wifi with my tablet in the couch. Moreover it should be possible to browse the files on computer 
in the file explorer.

All existing solutions doesn't fit my requirements or being expensive. So I begun to build a solution to myself. For the last
years I use phobox on my own, so I am my best tester. I see the flaws by using the software for myself and in that way 
very motivated to fix issues or simplify processes. 

Phobox is a very special project for me and I will never want to do without it again. But currently the development is completely
in my spare time. If you like phobox and you want to support me, please buy a license.
